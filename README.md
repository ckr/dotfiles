# dotfiles
My github dotfiles to make anywhere feel like `$HOME`

This project is here for github to read for [codespaces](https://github.blog/2020-05-06-new-from-satellite-2020-github-codespaces-github-discussions-securing-code-in-private-repositories-and-more/#codespaces) when it's out of limited public beta.

For info about the dotfiles I use on my mac see [github:.dotfiles](https://github.com/ckr/.dotfiles) and for info on how I build my mac see my automation project using ansible [github:mac-dev-playbook](https://github.com/ckr/mac-dev-playbook)
